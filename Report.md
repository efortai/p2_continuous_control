## Task 2: Continuous Control  

### Introduction  
This is the report for the task of continuous controll. The project demonstrates how policy-based methods can be used to learn the optimal policy in a model-free Reinforcement Learning setting using a Unity environment, in which a double-jointed arm can move to target locations.  


### Algorithm  
The DDPG algorithm was implemented to train the agents. Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) is an algorithm which concurrently learns a Q-function and a policy. It uses off-policy data and the Bellman equation to learn the Q-function, and uses the Q-function to learn the policy.  
Hereâ€™s the pseudo-code of the algorithm:

### Ideas for Future Work
 - Try other algorithms such as Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Truncated Natural Policy Gradient (TNPG) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which have also demonstrated good performance with continuous control tasks.
- Try to explore the (very!) recent Distributed Distributional Deterministic Policy Gradients (D4PG) algorithm as another method for adapting DDPG for continuous control.  
- Implement DDPG with HER (Hindsight Experience Replay)
